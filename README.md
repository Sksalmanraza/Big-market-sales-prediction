# Big Mart Sales Prediction

This repository contains a predictive modeling project aimed at forecasting sales for Big Mart stores. The analysis is conducted using Python, leveraging popular data science libraries.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the sales of various products at different Big Mart outlets based on historical data. This can help the business optimize inventory, pricing, and store operations.

## Features of the Project
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Insights into the data through visualizations.
  - Identification of patterns and trends in sales.
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handling missing values and outliers.
  - Encoding categorical variables.
  - Scaling numerical features.
- **Modeling and Evaluation:**
  - Use of advanced regression models like XGBoost.
  - Evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- **`numpy`**: For numerical computations.
- **`pandas`**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **`matplotlib`**: For creating static visualizations.
- **`seaborn`**: For statistical data visualization.
- **`sklearn`**: For machine learning model building and evaluation.
- **`xgboost`**: For implementing the XGBoost regression model.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project includes various features such as product attributes, store details, and historical sales data. It comprises 2013 sales data for 1,559 products across 10 stores in different cities. This dataset is essential for building and evaluating the predictive models.

You can access and download the dataset from Kaggle using the following link:
